<p>All rights to these transcripts, of course, belong to someone who is not you. This work is protected by U.S. Copyright Law, All Rights Reserved and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, that means you do <em>not</em> have permission to grab this transcript and run off with it to print it in a book or something like that. If you have grand ideas of how that might be cool, <a href="http://jensimmons.com/contact">contact me</a>. A book would be cool. But meanwhile, it's very illegal for you to cut and paste this whole transcript into your spammy link-baity website, pretending that its yours. Don't do that.</p>

<p>You do, of course, have full rights to quote <em>parts</em> of this conversation in something you are making &#8212; like a a blog post, or paper for school, or a collection of stuff on a website. A link back to here and a mention of the show would be greatly appreciated. At a minimum, do be sure to credit the person who said the quote.</p> 

<p>While we are talking about rights, you actually don't need my permission to quote parts of this conversation. You have my permission, but honestly, I don't have any control over granting it to you. You already automatically and always have the right to quote something when you are commenting on it, critiquing it, or remixing it. Did you listen to <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead/4">episode 4</a>, when Pat Aufderheide explains Fair Use? It's all about when you can use other people's copyrighted material in your work. Part of what's cool about these transcripts is that it makes it much easier for you to quote the show. So feel free!</p>
